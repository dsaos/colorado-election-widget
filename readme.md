# Colorado Election Widget
This widget was created for [CPR.org](http://www.cpr.org)'s 2016 Election coverage. Throughout election night, CPR News staff embedded this page into their reports, which automatically updated several races and their progress in Colorado, generated by automatically updating XML-based data from the Secretary of State.
